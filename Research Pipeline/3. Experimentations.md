- quick iteration principle, make small steps
	- not sure what algo or hparams to choose? just run all and tune(grid search, etc)
		- [loss func](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-which-loss-and-activation-functions-should-i-use-ac02f1c56aa8)
		- [google testing & debugging](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/testing-debugging/common/overview)
	- if high cost, consider switching baseline implementation, evaluation dataset, or even review idea
- extend experiments coverage
	- refer to baseline settings
	- ablation study of each component
	- extend evaluation dataset
		- data augmentation
		- add some noise or mixup to test the robustness
- Analysis: interpret experiments results
	- statistics with graphs
	- case study on certain aspects
